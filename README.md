# magento2-ReachDigital_CurrencyPricing

### Installation
Make sure that rates are set for all currencies that are supposed to be used. 
The rates are used as a fallback mechanism in case no price has been set for a product in the current currency.
If the rate is not set for the currency the base currency will be used instead, even if the price has been set for a product for the current currency.
